    <h1>Panneer Pizza</h1>

    <p>
     Paneer pizza is a fusion dish that combines the Italian classic pizza with Indian flavors, 
    featuring paneer cheese as a prominent ingredient. Paneer, a type of fresh cheese common in Indian cuisine,
    is often used in various dishes due to its mild flavor and ability to absorb spices well.

 <h1>Ingredients</h1>
 <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough or pre-made pizza crust</li>
        <li>Paneer cheese, cubed or crumbled</li>
        <li>Bell peppers (red, green, yellow), sliced</li>
        <li>Onions, thinly sliced</li>    
        <li>Tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>Olive oil (for brushing the crust)</li> 
        <li>Spices such as cumin, coriander, chili powder, and salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>    
        <li>  Cheese (optional, for additional topping or layering)</li>
        <li>Garlic, minced (optional, for added flavor)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Preparation</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified for your pizza dough. It's typically around 450°F (230°C) for homemade pizzas.</li>
    <li>Prepare the pizza dough: If you're using homemade pizza dough, roll it out on a lightly floured surface into your desired shape and thickness. If you're using a pre-made pizza crust, you can skip this step.</li>
    <li>Prepare the toppings: Chop the bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, 
        and any other vegetables you want to use. Cube or crumble the paneer cheese.</li>
    
    <li>Prepare the sauce: If you're making your own tomato sauce,
         you can cook it on the stove by simmering crushed tomatoes with garlic,
         onions, and spices until it thickens. Alternatively, 
        you can use store-bought pizza sauce or marinara sauce</li>

    <li>Assemble the pizza: Place the rolled-out pizza dough on a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, 
        leaving a small border around the edges for the crust. Sprinkle your desired spices over the sauce for added flavor.</li>

    <li>Add the toppings: Evenly distribute the chopped vegetables and paneer cheese over the sauce.
         You can also sprinkle some additional cheese on top if you like your pizza extra cheesy.</li>

    <li>Bake the pizza: Place the assembled pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, 
        or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    
     <li>Finish and serve: Once the pizza is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
         Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves if desired. Slice the pizza and serve hot. </li>
</ol>
<h1>Tip</h1>
<p>Use fresh paneer: Fresh paneer will have the best texture and flavor. If possible, make or buy paneer that is freshly made for optimal taste.

    Marinate the paneer: For added flavor, marinate the paneer cubes in a mixture of yogurt and spices for at least 30 minutes before using them as a pizza topping. This will infuse the paneer with extra taste and tenderness.
